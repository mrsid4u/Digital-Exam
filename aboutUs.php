            A site for educators, DigitalExam allows them to administer tests in a fast and reliable way.
             If you're one, this new platform lets you create tests using an interface that is intuitive before anything else, 
             and that is hosted 100 % online. You don't have to install anything on your own computer.

 Anywhere there's a computer that can access the Internet will do. In all cases, you are the one choosing who 
 is being able to take any of your tests, and you'll get to see and manage results right as they come along. 
 And a site like DigitalExam is also one that people who want to become more knowledgeable will find greatly useful. 
 If you're one such individual, you can come to the site, browse through these topics that you want to master and then
take as many exams as you wish. If you are restless for knowledge, you can take one after the other the whole night through, until the morning comes.
